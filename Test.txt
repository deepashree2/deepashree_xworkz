Java

1. Java is a high level Language and it is a Platform indepedent language 
	Javac is compile the code which will return by the coder.
	
2.	JDK- Java Development Kit - it provides space for user to return the program.
	JRE- Java Runtime Environment - it will provide runtime of the program.
	JVM- Java Virtual Machine - it gives the output using byte code and also generate a bytecode. and print it on the console.
	
3. Array it is sensitive in datatype we can write particular value to particular Datatype, if we give integer values to String 
	data type it does not work.
	
4. Class: it is primative data, or customized data we can use at declartion of the program.
   Object: it is a real world entity it has state and behaviour. every object has a state and behaviour based on that user
   will return the program.
   Signature of class: signatures are type abstractions or interfaces of classes.
   
5. Array: it is container it can store the same value of Datatype which we declared.

6. .java file: .java is user Writing and understand  program it will return by the programmer this file do not understand by JvM 
   .class: it is bytecode program .java file can not understand by the JVM.
   
7.  Length of the array is 5.

8. it is another class created with in the class.

9. Java is a high level Language and it is a Platform indepedent language.

10. Variable is a hold the value of data type,
	there are three types of variable
	instance variable : craeted after the class function mean outside of the constructor and varible call at anyside of the program.
	static variable: variable decalared with in the same body, and varible also called with in the outside of the body.
	void variable:  variable decalared with in the same body, and varible also called with in the same body.
	
11. class variable: Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, 
	but outside a method, constructor or a block.

12. Data types : There are 2 types of Data 
	1. Primative Datatype: short, byte, int, long, char, float, double, boolean(8 types): this data types are bulit by java.
	2. Non-primative Datatype : String, classes name and instances(non-primative data programmer can defined itself)
	
13. Java features: using java 3 Billion software are running at present.
		1. Java used for mobile also.
		2. Development of application.
		3. It used in web development.
		4. It is used in robotics.

14. Types of array in java:
	There is 2 type of array in java
	1. Single diementional array.
	2. Double/dynamic diementional array.

15. In Java, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception that occurs when we try to access an array 
    or a collection that is backed by an array with an invalid index. This means that the index is either less than
   zero or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

16. System.out.println(""); it is a meesage , this will return on the console it is not a output.

17. It is a mathematical operation, "==" it means eqaulto Double operator is a, equals() 
	return true if doubleValue() are equal is == for double and "equals()" for Double 
	guaranteed to evaluate to true for 2 variables initialized using the same literal

18. The dot operator, also known as separator or period used to separate a variable or method from a reference variable.

19. the base class of all the clases is main class it means main method,
	class name{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			}
	} // this is the base clases of all the classes.
